# Welcome to NextElectricians

Hello!

Welcome to my github repository for a website I am building for a mate, business name is NextElectricians.
This is my first big project that might get published on the WWW, and that is exciting and scary. Does it look good? Does it function well? Did I write poor code? I dont know... And that scares me as I don't know what a properly written website/project is like as I'm self taught.

Anyhows, If you're looking at this repo, either I sent this to you for feedback or I'm applying for a job :D. Regardless if you've got feedback, I'm all ears as I want to improve myself

Anyyyways, Thanks!
